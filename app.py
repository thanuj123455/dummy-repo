# role gate: Super Admin / Admin / Pro code developer). Installed HERE, in the
# deterministic entrypoint, so it applies no matter what the generated server
# module contains — and there is no configuration that removes it. A server
# missing its JWT public key or Redis credentials starts and denies every
# call (fail closed) rather than serving tools anonymously.
