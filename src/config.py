"""Environment-backed settings for the data2 MCP server.

Server-process configuration only (bind address, port). The datasource
connection — host, port, database, user AND credentials — is NEVER read from
the environment: it arrives as tool parameters on every call, injected by the
platform from the configured datasource, so one deployed server serves many
datasources without holding anyone's connection or secrets.
